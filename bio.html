        <p>
            I started the path to where I am now from picking ICT OCR nationals at GCSE,after this I went straight to sixth form In the September of 2013 to study ICT, Maths, Applied science and Media at AS level but I soon left as I preferred a more hands on approach
            to ICT. This then is when I went to college and did and extended diploma Hardware and Networking for 2 years. Now I find myself here doing assignments at the University of Northampton for 3 years. I also spend plenty time at my custom built
            computer, weather its playing games with friends, watching videos/ live streams, following E-sports (mainly Counter strike and Dota 2). In my spare time I also Co-own a gaming community, we currently run 20 servers worldwide which have had
            125,000 single people join. From this we have just secured a sponsorship from a large company CSGObig.com to pay for server costs and wages.
