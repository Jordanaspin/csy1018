project work
For me the project work has been hard going.
overall it has taken me around 30 hours to get the website to the stage of submitting.
When working on the website I did everything from the top then down.
starting with the header which was easily implemented and styled to the way I wanted it.
Next I did the navbar here I too inspiration from http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp with this I couldn't find a solution to remove the long and empty grey space. I know I could have used flex elements but I couldn't quite understand how they worked properly.
After this I advanced to just adding in the content on the pages, here I struggled for quite a long time trying to get the text to wrap around the images but I think that is properly implemented now.
After I got 1 page done I found myself with something to work off of for the next page so the content went into those pages quite easily.
The next problem I had then was with how to do a form so I got some inspiration from http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp. after the form went in I went ahead and finished up by making the footer which was based off of the header. This was quite easily implemented.
Most of all I struggled alot with making this I knew what I wanted to do but I didn't understand how to implement it into the code.
On the positive side I think that I have implemented the nav bar well alothough some elements of it could be made better for me it is one of the more advanced thigns in the website.
Overall I am happy with the finished website as I have had no previous ventures into making a full website on my own and it was alot to take in learning and trying things that i have never really looked at before.
